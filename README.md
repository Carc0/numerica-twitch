## Game Description
Does your chat know how to count?

Numerica is a mini-game created to be used on Twitch.  The goal is simple: reach the highest possible score.

- Each time a viewer types a number, the counter will increase. 
- If a viewer types the wrong number, the counter will restart, and the viewer gets an optional but well-deserved timeout.
- A viewer can't type two consecutive numbers.

Good luck!

## Featuring "Very Simple Twitch Chat" Unity Plugin
This game was entirely developed on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/RothioTome) as an example of how to use the [Very Simple Twitch Chat Plugin](https://github.com/rothiotome/very-simple-twitch-chat)

## Notes on compilation
This software requires a Client ID/Client Secret created on the [Twitch Developer Dashboard](https://dev.twitch.tv/) to be able to timeout/grant vip to viewers. Secrets are not included in the repository - for obvious reasons.
